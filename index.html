        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Bryam Terrones">
        <p>Hi everyone<br>
            My name is Bryam Carlos Daniel Terrones Figueroa, and I am currently pursuing my studies at BYU Pathway Worldwide and the Universidad Tecnológica del Perú,
            based in Chiclayo.
            I am 21 years old and have a strong passion for technology, particularly in the areas of programming and computer networks.
            I also enjoy listening to music, especially cumbia and pop, and I have a special love for chocolate cake and watermelon.
            I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully in the field of technology.
        </p>
        <p>One of the things I value most is the spiritual peace I find through my beliefs.
             Temples are sacred places where I feel closer to God and find inspiration to
              live a better life. They represent dedication, love, and a commitment to
               eternal principles that guide my everyday choices. 
            </p>
