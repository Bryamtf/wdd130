        <p>Hi everyone<br>
            My name is Bryam Carlos Daniel Terrones Figueroa, and I am currently pursuing my studies at BYU Pathway Worldwide and the Universidad Tecnológica del Perú,
            based in Chiclayo.
            I am 21 years old and have a strong passion for technology, particularly in the areas of programming and computer networks.
            I also enjoy listening to music, especially cumbia and pop, and I have a special love for chocolate cake and watermelon.
            I am committed to continuous learning and personal growth, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully in the field of technology.

                unforgettable adventures. Its rich blend of ancient traditions and colonial
